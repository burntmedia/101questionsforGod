            <h3>How to Use This Tool</h3>
            <p>Sometimes, it's helpful to have some ideas of things to help you start chatting to God. Conversation is best when it's two-way! So remember to listen if God is saying anything back and then carry on the conversation.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Think of these ideas as conversation starters rather than stand-alone topics. It doesn't really matter what you chat about - the idea is just to keep connecting with God and weave it into any and every part of your day. You could use this while putting on shoes, in the bath, or anytime you want to start a conversation with God.</p>
